# Introduction

I'm doing something that I've never seen somebody else did. This could be very
interesting for me and geeks, while maybe not to the other one's taste.

But anyway, I decide to go.

# How to

Decrypting programming is written by different types of programming languages that
I know and can really do hand-on work.

All those programs, no matter scripting, compiled, or native, only accept one argument
from command line, that is a file path, and the file contains encrypted content. The
output is purely string to stdout, so you can read it in terminal or redirect it to file,
but it's all up to you.

## farewell.rb

`ruby farewell.rb </path/to/encrypted/file>`

## farewell.py

`python farewell.py </path/to/encrypted/file>`

## farewell.c

1. `gcc -o farewell farewell.c`
2. `./farewell </path/to/encrypted/file>`

## farewell.java
