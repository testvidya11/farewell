# Procrastination

It has been a long time since I planned to write this farewell letter, but due to
my procrastination, it has been delayed ever since then. While things foreseen to
happen will eventually happen, I have no execute to finish it now.

# A Geek's Way

Forgive me that I'm writing it in this way, but since I do believe I am a so-called
geek, I'd rather say _period_ in my own style. So if you feel any offence in any kind,
I apologize for that, sincerely.

# Looking back

People are always saying that they're still remembering something happened in their
life, and that is really true and makes no exception for me.

I can still recall the day I went to the old office for interview, the day I came to
this office even before everybody was moving in, the day I came for intern, and the
day I came to work as an employee.

This is my first job after graduating from university. I am not sure what this means
to others, but for me, it means a completely fresh new start of my entire life.

## Coach

Larry has always been a good coach and I've learned quite a lot from him. With his help,
I grew up quickly, getting to know EMA the product, learning how to do things effectively,
and building my own social network within the company.

My two managers, Peter and Lishan, they are so kind offering me great opptunities to grow,
and I really appreciate their advices, both techically and non-technically. All of my
achievements during these years belong to them as well.

## Team

It was really fantastic that the day I joined DP was the day scrum team just started to build
up. It's a great honor to work within team, which makes me feel strength, spirit and friendship.

As my story, I've been working in only one team which is Ganjiang. I once wrote a long article about
the team when last time we were chosen as best team yearly. I won't repeat it, but it is really
a great team to work in. Wheter you believe it or not, the unofficial afternoon team break was
originally imported by Ganjiang from Karlskrona, when we were intentionally misusing the Swedish word
[`fika`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_\(coffee_break\)).

The man whose name has something to do with rocks or rocket taught me quite a lot about how to work
in a team. In any sense, he is one of my best guide ever.

## All about The Others

If I really need to work out an acknowledgement list, it would be just too long to fit into one
file, and I'm afraid everybody will ask me to do refactoring, in one way or another. So, instead
of doing such a tedious thing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you. Without
you, I will inevitably delay all my DPs, give wrong solution to all TRs, and report time to all
wrong network codes.

__Thank you very much!__

# Looking forward

My friends, life is too peaceful that I need some change. I can not predict whether it is good
or not, but it worths a try, and I will hold on to my choice. The sky will never fall down, and
even if it does, I am not the tallest guy.

I will be still working for this company, just moving to another department. It is not the time
for me to say _Ericsson is a great company_, because there will always be a `but` after that. But
I'm not going to say `but`, so I would rather say:

> TO WORK FOR ERICSSON IS A GREAT PLEASURE AND MY HONOR

I will be keeping using `ehonlia` as my ID, while might change email address a little bit in order
to ease the pronunciation and written effort for my now colleagues. If you do not mind an email spam,
I will keep you informed after.
